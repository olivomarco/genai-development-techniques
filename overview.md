# GenAI Development Techniques — Overview & Comparison

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The landscape of AI-assisted software development has matured dramatically by April 2026. What began as raw prompting and "vibe coding" has evolved into a rich ecosystem of structured methodologies, multi-agent frameworks, and enterprise-grade workflows — all designed to make AI coding agents more predictable, productive, and safe at scale. The core shift is philosophical: developers are no longer asking "can AI write code?" but "how do I *direct* AI to write the *right* code, reliably, every time?" The answer, across every technique studied, is some form of specification-first thinking combined with disciplined context engineering.

Seven distinct approaches have emerged as Tier 1 techniques, spanning four categories. **Spec-driven development** (GSD, Spec Kit) focuses on defining exactly what you want before the AI builds it. **Multi-agent orchestration** (Squad, BMAD) simulates development teams with specialized AI agents working in parallel. **Autonomous iteration** (Ralph) takes the radical approach of running AI agents in a bash loop overnight, using tests as backpressure. **Enterprise AI-native SDLC** (HVE) brings constraint-based governance and validated artifacts to the development lifecycle. Underneath them all sits **context engineering** — the cross-cutting discipline of curating what information fills the AI's context window.

The choice between these approaches is not about which is "best" — it's about matching the technique to your situation. A solo developer prototyping a weekend project has fundamentally different needs than an enterprise team shipping regulated software with audit requirements. This document provides the data and decision frameworks to make that match.

## 5. Category Summaries

### Spec-Driven Development — GSD, Spec Kit

Spec-driven development (SDD) is the most intuitive response to the chaos of unstructured AI coding: write down what you want before the AI builds it. **GSD** is the community champion — 51K GitHub stars, a 6-step slash-command workflow, and a "Lean Orchestrator" that spawns fresh agents per task to avoid context rot. It was built for Claude Code but has community ports for other tools. **Spec Kit** is GitHub's official entry — a lighter-weight toolkit that organizes projects around `.specify/` directories with specs, plans, and tasks. Where GSD is opinionated and comprehensive, Spec Kit is minimal and agent-agnostic. Both share the conviction that disciplined specification prevents the "AI assumed what I wanted" failure mode.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration — Squad, BMAD

Multi-agent systems simulate development teams where each AI agent has a specialized role. **BMAD** is the heavyweight — 44K stars, 12+ named agent personas (PM, Architect, Dev, QA), scale-adaptive intelligence, and an extensible module ecosystem. It's the closest to a full agile shop simulation. **Squad** takes a different approach: a coordinator spawns named agents in parallel, with persistent memory (charters, decisions, history files) and structured ceremonies. It's tightly integrated with GitHub Copilot and includes a built-in work monitor (Ralph) for continuous pipeline management. Both prove that structuring AI collaboration produces better results than a single AI working alone, though they trade simplicity for coordination overhead.

### Autonomous Iteration — Ralph

Ralph stands alone in its category: a bash one-liner that runs an AI coding agent in a loop, using tests as backpressure and git commits as memory between iterations. Created by Geoffrey Huntley and named after Ralph Wiggum from *The Simpsons* ("keep going despite always making mistakes"), it's the philosophical opposite of enterprise frameworks. There is no governance, no agent roles, no structured phases — just a prompt, a loop, and a test suite. Its power lies in simplicity and overnight productivity: set it running before bed, wake up to completed features. The trade-off is unpredictability — Huntley himself calls it "deterministically bad in a nondeterministic world" — and it works best on greenfield projects with clear completion criteria.

### Enterprise AI-Native SDLC — HVE

Hypervelocity Engineering (HVE) is the enterprise end of the spectrum. Created by Microsoft's ISE team from lessons learned shipping 140+ AI solutions, it embeds AI agents across the entire development lifecycle through the RPI workflow: Research (investigate and document), Plan (create coordinated task files), Implement (execute with verification), Review (validate against plan). With 49 agents, 102 instructions, and 10 domain-specific collections, HVE provides constraint-based governance where "constraints enable safe autonomy." It's designed for multi-stack enterprise environments (no-code to pro-code) and trades setup simplicity for repeatable, auditable, governable AI-assisted development. The key insight: separating research from implementation changes the AI's optimization target from "plausible code" to "verified truth."

### Cross-Cutting: Context Engineering

Context engineering is not a framework — it's the foundational practice that every framework implements differently. Popularized by Andrej Karpathy's analogy ("the LLM is a CPU, the context window is RAM, and you are the operating system"), it's the discipline of curating exactly what fills the AI's context window. In practice, this manifests as an 8-layer model from system instructions down to auto-memory, implemented through tool-specific rules files: `.cursorrules` (Cursor), `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot), and `AGENTS.md`. GSD solves context rot through fresh agents per task. Ralph solves it through fresh loops. HVE clears context between RPI phases. The specific mechanism varies, but the principle is universal: what you put in the context window matters more than how you phrase the prompt.
